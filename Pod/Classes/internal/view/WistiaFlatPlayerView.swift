//  A slightly smarter View for AVPlayerLayers
//
//  Set the playerLayer and it will be sized exactly as the normal layer.
//  Now you can live in the View world instead of the lower level nitty gritty.
//
//  *** Important: do not set the frame, bounds, position, or anchorPoint of playerLayer
//  after it is set.  Result is undefined.

                //and thereby match the this view's frame, we need to do a few things...
